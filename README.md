### BT Module:
For BT Module I havent found any good explanation but you can check my github repository [here](www.github.com/IrfanNafiz/Gambit) for the BT code, i'll update the documentation with relevant BT videos later.
The repo has all the codes from my runner-up project from last april.

### Other suggestions:
[Paul McWhorter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYfK0tzHZTpNFrc_NDKfTA) and [Drone Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/c/Dronebotworkshop1) whose videos I linked is also excellent at explaining indepth many things if you want to pursue robotics.
